## 📝 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Set Project Foundation
**Purpose**: Establish project context and requirements

**Prompt to Use**:
```
I want to start a new project called Sales Analytics Application. The users are Sales Rep (field) and Sales Manager. It's a web platform (desktop-first, responsive). Tech stack: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Node.js backend. Brand: Primary #0B5FFF, Accent #00C49A, Inter font (16px base). Requirements: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile support, no external analytics vendors. Goals: Increase lead-to-opportunity conversion by 10%, reduce time-to-insight for sales managers, track dashboard activation, time-to-insight, weekly active users (WAU).
```

**Expected Output**: Project foundation and context setting
**Time Required**: 5 minutes

---

### Step 2: Create UX Discovery Document
**Purpose**: Research user goals, pain points, and success metrics

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create a UX discovery document for the Sales Analytics Application. Include user goals, pain points, current challenges, and success metrics. Focus on Sales Rep and Sales Manager workflows. The goal is to increase lead-to-opportunity conversion by 10% and reduce time-to-insight. Save to: design/discovery.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/discovery.md` with comprehensive user research
**Time Required**: 10 minutes

---

### Step 3: Build Design System
**Purpose**: Establish visual design language and component standards

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create a design system document for the Sales Analytics Application. Include colors (primary #0B5FFF, accent #00C49A), typography (Inter font, 16px base), spacing, components, and accessibility guidelines. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Save to: design/design-system.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/design-system.md` with complete design system
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

---

### Step 4: Develop User Personas
**Purpose**: Create detailed user profiles for design decisions

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create user personas for the Sales Analytics Application. Include 3 personas: Field Sales Rep, Sales Manager, and Sales Operations Analyst. For each persona, include demographics, goals, frustrations, tech comfort level, and daily workflows. Save to: design/personas.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/personas.md` with 3 detailed personas
**Time Required**: 10 minutes

---

### Step 5: Map User Journeys
**Purpose**: Document critical user workflows and pain points

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create a detailed user journey for Marcus Rodriguez (Sales Manager) doing his weekly pipeline review. The goal is a 15-minute efficient review process. Include steps, touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities. Also include error flows and success criteria. Save to: design/user-journeys/sales-manager-weekly-pipeline.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/user-journeys/sales-manager-weekly-pipeline.md`
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

---

### Step 6: Design Information Architecture
**Purpose**: Plan navigation structure and content organization

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create a sitemap and information architecture for the Sales Analytics Application. Include main sections: Dashboard, Leads, Opportunities, Reports, Settings. Plan for role-based access, mobile navigation, and user workflows. Save to: design/sitemap.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/sitemap.md` with complete site structure
**Time Required**: 10 minutes

---

### Step 7: Create Dashboard Wireframes
**Purpose**: Design layout and component relationships

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create wireframes for the main Dashboard page of the Sales Analytics Application. Include header, KPI cards, pipeline funnel chart, team performance table, and activity feed. Design for desktop and mobile responsive layouts. Use ASCII art wireframes. Save to: design/wireframes/dashboard-wireframe.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/wireframes/dashboard-wireframe.md` with detailed layouts
**Time Required**: 20 minutes

---

### Step 8: Build React Components
**Purpose**: Create development-ready component scaffolds

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Based on the wireframes, create React + TypeScript component scaffolds for the dashboard. Include: DashboardLayout, Header, KPIGrid, PipelineFunnelPlaceholder, RepsTablePlaceholder, ActivityFeedPlaceholder. Use Tailwind CSS classes, include TypeScript interfaces, ARIA labels, and accessibility features. Save to src/components/dashboard/
```

**Expected Output**: 6 React component files in `src/components/dashboard/`
**Time Required**: 25 minutes

---

### Step 9: Create Design Token System
**Purpose**: Standardize design values and CSS variables

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create a comprehensive design token system for the Sales Analytics Application. Include colors (brand #0B5FFF, #00C49A, semantic states), spacing (4px base unit), typography (Inter), elevation, and animation tokens. Use CSS custom properties format. Save to: design/tokens.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/tokens.md` with complete token system
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

---

### Step 10: Configure Tailwind CSS
**Purpose**: Extend Tailwind with custom design tokens

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Create the Tailwind CSS configuration file that extends the default theme with our design tokens. Include custom colors (#0B5FFF primary, #00C49A accent), spacing scale (4px base), typography (Inter font), and component utilities. Include installation instructions. Save to: design/tailwind.config.js
```

**Expected Output**: `design/tailwind.config.js` with extended theme
**Time Required**: 10 minutes

---

### Step 11: Document Core Components
**Purpose**: Specify component APIs and accessibility requirements

**Prompt to Use**:
```
For Button, Table (RepsTable), and Modal components used on Dashboard, produce short component docs: props, default values, states (hover/active/disabled), keyboard behaviors, and ARIA roles/labels. Also list automated accessibility tests to run (axe rules or checks). Save output to: design/components.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/components.md` with component specifications
**Time Required**: 20 minutes

---

### Step 12: Define Responsive Design
**Purpose**: Specify how components adapt across breakpoints

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Define breakpoints for desktop-first responsive design: desktop >= 1024px, tablet 768–1023px, mobile < 768px. For the Dashboard page, describe how KPI grid, pipeline chart, and reps table should rearrange at each breakpoint with Tailwind utility guidance (e.g., use grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-1). Save output to: design/responsive.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/responsive.md` with responsive specifications
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

---

### Step 13: Write Interface Microcopy
**Purpose**: Create user-friendly text for all interface elements

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Write microcopy for the Dashboard: header titles, empty-state text for reps table, 'No data' messages for charts, tooltips for KPI cards, confirmation text for 'Refresh data' action. Tone: helpful, professional, and concise. Save output to: design/microcopy.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/microcopy.md` with comprehensive copy
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

---

### Step 14: Create Accessibility Framework
**Purpose**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and testing procedures

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Produce an accessibility checklist for the Dashboard to meet WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast checks, keyboard navigation, focus order, ARIA usage, labels, semantic HTML. Also recommend linters and CI steps to run (axe-core CLI, eslint-plugin-jsx) with sample commands. Save output to: design/accessibility.md
```

**Expected Output**: `design/accessibility.md` with compliance framework
**Time Required**: 20 minutes

---

### Step 15: Review and Identify Risks
**Purpose**: Assess potential issues and mitigation strategies

**Prompt to Use**:
```
Review the generated UI components for potential design risks or issues under these categories: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1), Usability, Responsiveness, Consistency with design system, Performance or rendering concerns, Data/API dependency risks. List each issue found under a 'Watch Outs' section, and provide a short mitigation recommendation for each.
```

**Expected Output**: `design/component-review-watchouts.md` with risk assessment
**Time Required**: 15 minutes
