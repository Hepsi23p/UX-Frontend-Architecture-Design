## Top 5 User Goals

### Sales Representatives (Field)
1. **Quick Lead Qualification Assessment**
   - *Rationale*: Field reps need rapid access to lead scoring and qualification data to prioritize their daily activities and maximize conversion opportunities during limited face-to-face time.

2. **Mobile-First Pipeline Management**
   - *Rationale*: Field reps are constantly mobile and need responsive access to update opportunity status, log activities, and access customer insights while on-the-go.

3. **Actionable Next-Step Recommendations**
   - *Rationale*: Reps want clear, data-driven guidance on what actions to take next with each prospect to move them through the pipeline efficiently.

### Sales Managers
4. **Real-Time Team Performance Visibility**
   - *Rationale*: Managers need instant access to team metrics, conversion rates, and pipeline health to make informed coaching decisions and resource allocation.

5. **Predictive Pipeline Forecasting**
   - *Rationale*: Managers require accurate forecasting tools to anticipate revenue, identify risks early, and adjust strategies proactively.

## Top 5 Pain Points

### Sales Representatives (Field)
1. **Data Entry Overhead**
   - *Rationale*: Manual data entry reduces selling time and creates resistance to CRM adoption, leading to incomplete or inaccurate pipeline data.

2. **Lack of Mobile Optimization**
   - *Rationale*: Current tools are desktop-centric, forcing reps to delay updates or use suboptimal mobile interfaces that hinder productivity.

3. **Information Fragmentation**
   - *Rationale*: Critical customer insights are scattered across multiple systems, requiring time-consuming context switching and reducing customer interaction quality.

### Sales Managers
4. **Delayed Reporting and Insights**
   - *Rationale*: Traditional reporting cycles create lag time between events and insights, preventing timely interventions and strategic adjustments.

5. **Limited Visibility into Rep Activities**
   - *Rationale*: Managers lack real-time visibility into rep activities and customer interactions, making it difficult to provide targeted coaching and support.

## Proposed Success Metrics

### 1. Dashboard Activation Rate
**Target**: 85% of users actively using dashboard within first week
- *Rationale*: High activation indicates intuitive design and immediate value delivery. This metric directly correlates with user adoption and long-term engagement, ensuring the application becomes integral to daily workflows.

### 2. Time-to-Insight Reduction
**Target**: 40% reduction in time from data access to actionable decision
- *Rationale*: Directly addresses the primary goal of reducing time-to-insight for sales managers. Faster insights enable more agile decision-making and proactive pipeline management, ultimately improving conversion rates.

### 3. Weekly Active Users (WAU) Growth
**Target**: 90% WAU retention after month 1, with 15% month-over-month growth
- *Rationale*: Sustained engagement indicates the application provides ongoing value and supports daily workflows effectively. High retention suggests successful pain point resolution and goal achievement for both user personas.
