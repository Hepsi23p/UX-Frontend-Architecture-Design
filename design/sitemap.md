## Information Architecture Principles

### User-Centered Design
- **Task-Oriented Structure**: Navigation follows user workflows rather than system architecture
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features are layered to avoid overwhelming new users
- **Role-Based Experience**: Content and navigation adapt based on user permissions and role

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Secondary pages load on-demand to improve initial load times
- **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed data is cached for offline access
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript for accessibility

### Scalability Considerations
- **Modular Architecture**: Each section can be developed and deployed independently
- **Extensible Framework**: New features can be added without restructuring existing navigation
- **API-First Design**: All pages consume standardized data APIs for consistency
